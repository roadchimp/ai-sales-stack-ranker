Problem

Sales teams operate on static pipeline reports, weak qualification discipline, and spotty interaction telemetry, making forecast accuracy and rep prioritization unreliable.

Solution

A predictive ranker that analyzes historical closed-won patterns, current interaction signals, and MEDDICC coverage to estimate close probability, identify risks, and suggest next actions.

Key Jobs To Be Done

As a sales leader: “Show me at-risk high-value deals and why, compared to similar wins.”

As an AE: “What’s my next best action? How does my opportunity stack up to similar successful deals?”

As RevOps: “Is the model drifting? Are features up to date?”

Experience Principles

Opinionated defaults, fast reads: sparkline timelines, benchmark overlays, clear risk badges.

Explainability-first: SHAP-style feature impact summaries, MEDDICC radar, velocity vs cohort lines.

Minimal configuration: start from CSVs; n8n/Salesforce later.

Privacy: never show raw PII in UI; redact transcripts in UI and logs.

Core Features (User-facing)

Ranker list: score, lift vs baseline, top drivers, aging, velocity deltas.

Opportunity detail: activity breakdown, velocity timeline, MEDDICC radar, benchmark scatter, risk/next-actions.

Coaching: rep performance page with actionable recommendations.
