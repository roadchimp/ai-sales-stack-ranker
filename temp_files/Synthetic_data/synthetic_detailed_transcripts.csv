REP: Hi Sarah, thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. I understand you're the VP of Data at TechCorp and you're looking into data governance solutions. Could you tell me a bit about your current data landscape?

PROSPECT: Hi, thanks for reaching out. Yes, we're definitely struggling with data discovery and compliance. We have data spread across multiple cloud environments - AWS, Azure, and some on-prem systems. Our biggest challenge is we can't easily find where our sensitive data lives.

REP: That's a common challenge we hear from companies your size. When you say sensitive data, are you primarily concerned about PII, financial data, or both?

PROSPECT: Both, actually. We handle customer personal information and financial transactions. With GDPR and now more state privacy laws coming into effect, we really need to get a handle on this. We had a close call last year during an audit.

REP: I can understand why that would be concerning. How are you currently handling data discovery and classification?

PROSPECT: It's mostly manual right now. Our data engineers spend way too much time trying to catalog everything. It's not scalable and honestly, we're probably missing a lot.

REP: What would success look like for you in terms of a data governance solution?

PROSPECT: We need automated discovery, proper classification of sensitive data, and the ability to quickly respond to data subject requests. Our legal team is constantly asking us where specific data is stored.

REP: Those are exactly the areas where BigID excels. We've helped similar companies in your industry reduce data discovery time by 75%. Would you be interested in seeing a demo of how our platform could address these specific challenges?

PROSPECT: Yes, that would be valuable. Could we include our CISO in that call? Data security is obviously a big concern for us.

REP: Absolutely. I'll also bring our solutions engineer who can speak to the technical aspects. What does your calendar look like next week?

REP: Thanks everyone for joining today's demo. I have Sarah, Mike from the security team, and Jennifer from legal. Let me show you how BigID can solve the data discovery challenges we discussed last week.

PROSPECT_SARAH: Great, we're excited to see this in action. Mike had some specific questions about our Azure environment.

PROSPECT_MIKE: Yes, we're particularly concerned about scanning our data lake without impacting performance. We have about 15TB of data and can't afford downtime.

REP: Perfect question, Mike. Let me show you our agentless scanning approach. [Screen sharing] As you can see here, BigID connects to your Azure data lake through APIs without requiring any agents or software installation...

PROSPECT_MIKE: Interesting. What about false positives? We've evaluated other tools that flagged everything as sensitive data.

REP: Great point. BigID uses machine learning models trained on millions of data samples. Our accuracy rate is typically above 95%. Here, let me show you a report from a customer with a similar environment to yours...

PROSPECT_JENNIFER: From a legal perspective, I need to understand how quickly we can respond to data subject requests. We're getting 20-30 requests per month now.

REP: Perfect use case for our DSAR module. Jennifer, what I'm showing here is how you can input a subject's email or ID, and BigID will automatically find all instances of their data across your entire environment in minutes, not weeks.

PROSPECT_SARAH: This looks impressive. What about integration with our existing tools? We use Snowflake for our data warehouse and ServiceNow for ticketing.

REP: Both are covered. We have pre-built connectors for Snowflake and can push findings directly into ServiceNow tickets. Would you like to see that integration?

PROSPECT_MIKE: Yes, and I'd also like to understand the pricing model. We need to get budget approval.

REP: Absolutely. Our pricing is typically based on data volume and the modules you need. For an environment your size with DSAR and discovery, we're usually in the $150-200K range annually. But let me get you exact pricing based on your specific requirements.

PROSPECT_SARAH: That's in our ballpark. What would be the next steps? We'd need to get our CTO involved before making a decision.

REP: I'd recommend a technical deep dive with your CTO and perhaps a pilot program where we can scan a subset of your data to show real results. Would next week work for that conversation?

REP: Hi David, thanks for the call. I know you've been reviewing our proposal. What questions can I answer for you?

PROSPECT: Hi, overall we like the solution, but I have some concerns about the pricing. The $240K you quoted is about 20% higher than what Collibra proposed.

REP: I appreciate you sharing that, David. Can you help me understand what Collibra's proposal includes? I want to make sure we're comparing apples to apples.

PROSPECT: They're including discovery, classification, and their governance catalog. The data volume coverage seems similar to what you proposed.

REP: Got it. A couple of questions - does their pricing include the automated DSAR capability that was critical for your legal team? And what about the ML-driven classification we showed you that reduces false positives?

PROSPECT: You know, I don't think the DSAR automation was included in their base package. That was a separate module. And honestly, their accuracy rates weren't as impressive in the proof of concept.

REP: Those are significant differences. The DSAR automation alone would typically add $40-50K to a competitive solution. Plus, the accuracy difference translates to hundreds of hours saved by your data team not chasing false positives.

PROSPECT: That's a fair point. But I still need to get this approved by our CFO, and that price difference is going to be hard to justify.

REP: I understand budget constraints are real. Let me ask - what if we could structure this as a phased implementation? Start with discovery and classification in year one at $180K, then add DSAR in year two?

PROSPECT: That could work. Would you include the same data volume coverage?

REP: Yes, and I'll include professional services to ensure successful deployment. If you can commit by the end of this month, I can also include our premium support at no additional cost for the first year.

PROSPECT: Let me run this by my team. The phased approach definitely helps with the budget. Can you send me a revised proposal by Friday?

REP: Absolutely. I'll have that to you by Thursday. And David, I'm confident this solution will deliver the ROI you need, especially with the time savings we discussed.
