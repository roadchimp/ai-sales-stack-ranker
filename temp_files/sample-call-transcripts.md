### Call Transcript #1: Discovery Call - Data Governance Solution

**Date**: 2024-11-15  
**Duration**: 45 minutes  
**Participants**: Sales Rep (BigID), VP of Data (TechCorp), CISO (TechCorp)  
**Call Type**: Discovery  
**Outcome**: Demo Scheduled

**REP**: Hi Sarah, thanks for taking the time to speak with me today. I understand you're the VP of Data at TechCorp and you're looking into data governance solutions. Could you tell me a bit about your current data landscape?

**PROSPECT**: Hi, thanks for reaching out. Yes, we're definitely struggling with data discovery and compliance. We have data spread across multiple cloud environments - AWS, Azure, and some on-prem systems. Our biggest challenge is we can't easily find where our sensitive data lives.

**REP**: That's a common challenge we hear from companies your size. When you say sensitive data, are you primarily concerned about PII, financial data, or both?

**PROSPECT**: Both, actually. We handle customer personal information and financial transactions. With GDPR and now more state privacy laws coming into effect, we really need to get a handle on this. We had a close call last year during an audit.

**REP**: I can understand why that would be concerning. How are you currently handling data discovery and classification?

**PROSPECT**: It's mostly manual right now. Our data engineers spend way too much time trying to catalog everything. It's not scalable and honestly, we're probably missing a lot.

**REP**: What would success look like for you in terms of a data governance solution?

**PROSPECT**: We need automated discovery, proper classification of sensitive data, and the ability to quickly respond to data subject requests. Our legal team is constantly asking us where specific data is stored.

**REP**: Those are exactly the areas where BigID excels. We've helped similar companies in your industry reduce data discovery time by 75%. Would you be interested in seeing a demo of how our platform could address these specific challenges?

**PROSPECT**: Yes, that would be valuable. Could we include our CISO in that call? Data security is obviously a big concern for us.

**REP**: Absolutely. I'll also bring our solutions engineer who can speak to the technical aspects. What does your calendar look like next week?

### Call Transcript #2: Demo Call - Product Demonstration

**Date**: 2024-12-03  
**Duration**: 60 minutes  
**Participants**: Sales Rep, Solutions Engineer (BigID), VP Data, CISO, Legal Counsel (Customer)  
**Call Type**: Product Demo  
**Outcome**: Technical Deep Dive Scheduled

**REP**: Thanks everyone for joining today's demo. I have Sarah, Mike from the security team, and Jennifer from legal. Let me show you how BigID can solve the data discovery challenges we discussed last week.

**PROSPECT_SARAH**: Great, we're excited to see this in action. Mike had some specific questions about our Azure environment.

**PROSPECT_MIKE**: Yes, we're particularly concerned about scanning our data lake without impacting performance. We have about 15TB of data and can't afford downtime.

**REP**: Perfect question, Mike. Let me show you our agentless scanning approach. [Screen sharing] As you can see here, BigID connects to your Azure data lake through APIs without requiring any agents or software installation...

**PROSPECT_MIKE**: Interesting. What about false positives? We've evaluated other tools that flagged everything as sensitive data.

**REP**: Great point. BigID uses machine learning models trained on millions of data samples. Our accuracy rate is typically above 95%. Here, let me show you a report from a customer with a similar environment to yours...

**PROSPECT_JENNIFER**: From a legal perspective, I need to understand how quickly we can respond to data subject requests. We're getting 20-30 requests per month now.

**REP**: Perfect use case for our DSAR module. Jennifer, what I'm showing here is how you can input a subject's email or ID, and BigID will automatically find all instances of their data across your entire environment in minutes, not weeks.

**PROSPECT_SARAH**: This looks impressive. What about integration with our existing tools? We use Snowflake for our data warehouse and ServiceNow for ticketing.

**REP**: Both are covered. We have pre-built connectors for Snowflake and can push findings directly into ServiceNow tickets. Would you like to see that integration?

**PROSPECT_MIKE**: Yes, and I'd also like to understand the pricing model. We need to get budget approval.

**REP**: Absolutely. Our pricing is typically based on data volume and the modules you need. For an environment your size with DSAR and discovery, we're usually in the $150-200K range annually. But let me get you exact pricing based on your specific requirements.

**PROSPECT_SARAH**: That's in our ballpark. What would be the next steps? We'd need to get our CTO involved before making a decision.

**REP**: I'd recommend a technical deep dive with your CTO and perhaps a pilot program where we can scan a subset of your data to show real results. Would next week work for that conversation?

### Key Insights Extracted:
- **Technical Concerns**: Agentless scanning, API integration, data lake compatibility
- **Budget Qualified**: True - $150-200K annually range accepted
- **Decision Process**: CTO approval required
- **Integration Requirements**: Snowflake, ServiceNow
- **Next Steps**: Technical deep dive with CTO, pilot program

### Call Transcript #3: Negotiation Call - Pricing Discussion

**Date**: 2024-12-10  
**Duration**: 35 minutes  
**Participants**: Sales Rep (BigID), VP Data (Customer)  
**Call Type**: Negotiation  
**Outcome**: Revised Proposal Requested  

---

**REP**: Hi David, thanks for the call. I know you've been reviewing our proposal. What questions can I answer for you?

**PROSPECT**: Hi, overall we like the solution, but I have some concerns about the pricing. The $240K you quoted is about 20% higher than what Collibra proposed.

**REP**: I appreciate you sharing that, David. Can you help me understand what Collibra's proposal includes? I want to make sure we're comparing apples to apples.

**PROSPECT**: They're including discovery, classification, and their governance catalog. The data volume coverage seems similar to what you proposed.

**REP**: Got it. A couple of questions - does their pricing include the automated DSAR capability that was critical for your legal team? And what about the ML-driven classification we showed you that reduces false positives?

**PROSPECT**: You know, I don't think the DSAR automation was included in their base package. That was a separate module. And honestly, their accuracy rates weren't as impressive in the proof of concept.

**REP**: Those are significant differences. The DSAR automation alone would typically add $40-50K to a competitive solution. Plus, the accuracy difference translates to hundreds of hours saved by your data team not chasing false positives.

**PROSPECT**: That's a fair point. But I still need to get this approved by our CFO, and that price difference is going to be hard to justify.

**REP**: I understand budget constraints are real. Let me ask - what if we could structure this as a phased implementation? Start with discovery and classification in year one at $180K, then add DSAR in year two?

**PROSPECT**: That could work. Would you include the same data volume coverage?

**REP**: Yes, and I'll include professional services to ensure successful deployment. If you can commit by the end of this month, I can also include our premium support at no additional cost for the first year.

**PROSPECT**: Let me run this by my team. The phased approach definitely helps with the budget. Can you send me a revised proposal by Friday?

**REP**: Absolutely. I'll have that to you by Thursday. And David, I'm confident this solution will deliver the ROI you need, especially with the time savings we discussed.
